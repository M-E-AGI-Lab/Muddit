# 🌌 Muddit: A Unified Discrete Diffusion Model for Image & Text Generation

Welcome to the official repository of **Muddit** — a next-generation foundation model in the Meissonic family, built upon discrete diffusion for unified and efficient multimodal generation.

Unlike traditional autoregressive methods, **Muddit** leverages discrete diffusion (a.k.a. MaskGIT-style masking) as its core mechanism — enabling fast, parallel decoding across modalities.

While most unified models are still rooted in language priors, **Muddit** is developed from a visual-first perspective for scalable and flexible generation.
